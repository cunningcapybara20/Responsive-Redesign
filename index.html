    <h1 id="site-title">A Redesign of Feed the Cheeks website</h1>

    <div id="p-1">
        <h1 id="heading-title">Part 1: Identifying Usability Problems</h1>
        <br>
        <p id="p-text">The website I decided to redesign was the home page of the new Feed the Cheeks cookie shop. I have heard good things about the cookies' potential, but when taking a closer look at their website it could be better. It is pretty bare bones right now and can be made more appealing.</p>
        <br>
        <p id="p2-text">Here's a picture of their current website</p>
        <br>
        <img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%;" src="ftc-homepage.png" alt="This is Feed the Cheeks' homepage.">

        <h2 id="question-text">Finding Usability Problems</h2>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The first issue I noticed was that the nav bar at the top contains links to everything for the other pages. Typically this is okay, but I felt that it could be improved upon and simplified to allow the user to more easily digest all of the information on the page.
            </li>
            <li>
                The home page has poor usage of the space available. The page is definitely not cluttered visually, but it feels very empty as the user. Everything is packed at the top in the navigation bar and it is very specific. If I am a user wanting to find what types of cookies they have, it may not be super obvious to go to the order screen as opposed to a "menu" screen that other restaurants have. 
            </li>
            <li> 
                Another usability issue is the website is very monotonous, the whole webpage is pink and white and it can lead to some contrast issues. While the eye path for the user is pretty good because of this, the actual page is somewhat lacking an instant visual appeal.  
            </li>
        </ul> 
        <br>
        <h2 id="question-text">Accessibility Issues</h2>
        <br>
        <p id="p-text">Usability</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The usability of this website is pretty good overall, since the page has essentially everything at the top. The pages are very specific, which I would argue could cause more issues than necessary. Even with this though, the navigation bar is good for new users who are not familiar with the brand, what they do and what is possible
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p id="p-text">Learnability</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The learnability of this website is alright overall. I think that the page could benefit from having more on the home page that has to do with ordering from their store. It is different from other restaurants since they only sell cookies. They could begin by putting more that leads you to buying cookies right away rather than having unused space. 
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p id="p-text">Memorability</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The memorability of this website is pretty good overall because everything is linked at the top. Even if one was to not remember where things were located or how to reach a specific page, it is all right there. Otherwise, as alluded to previously, the page is for a cookie shop, so there isn't many places for the user to get "lost" along the way.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h1 id="question-text">WebAIM WAVE Tool Findings</h1>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The wave tool found several errors with images that were missing alternative text. 
            </li>
            <li>
                There were several contrast issues between the pale pink background and some of the logos they used (both for the store and those for some of the credit cards they mention at the bottom of the page). 
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p id="p-text">I agree with these findings from the wave tool. There are not many elements that could cause issues, so I am not surprised that there wasn't much that was wrong with it. The contrast issues I expected to be an issue to some extent. The shade of pink used in the website is a unique and identifying color for the brand, but it is similar enough to cause contrast issues. Finally, the pictures lacking alt text I did not expect. I would have expected that with the pictures they have of cookies and their logos currently it would have it for all of them.</p>

        <h1 id="heading-title">Part 2: Visual Redesign</h1>

        <h2 id="question-text">Low-fidelity Wireframes</h2>
        <br>
        <img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%;" src="desktop-lofi.png" alt="This is the lofi wireframe for desktop.">
        <p id="p-text">On the desktop wireframe, I wanted to have more immediately on the page when it is opened. Having more pictures about the cookies they make, they would be able to attract customers that aren't familiar with their products by showing both variety and consistency. Furthermore the idea is that the user can click on the cookie and it will link right to adding one of them to their cart and swap to the order page. This would give the user a quicker and more obvious route to ordering what they want just from the visual.</p>
        <br>
        <img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%;" src="ipad-lofi.png" alt="This is the lofi wireframe for an iPad.">
        <p id="p-text">For the tablet-sized screen, I looked at it similar to how I approached the phone screen. The goal is to have more visual that leads the user to learning more and becoming invested in the site. More interaction. I want the website to bring more users back after visiting it once. Having continual updates and news would help do that, especially if it was about special deals or discounts they had running currently.</p>
        <br>
        <img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%;" src="iphone-lofi.png" alt="This is the lofi wireframe for an iPhone.">
        <p id="p-text">Similar to the tablet size for the phone screen size, I felt that trying to have pictures would still be ideal to keep a visual pop for the screen, but it does make it more difficult with the size. The main idea with having the pictures and text is to continue to draw in new/returning customers with updates and news from them right on the home page. With their new opening, they could have promotions and new kinds of cookies to attract their customer base. </p>

        <h2 id="question-text">UI Style Guide</h2>
        <br>

        <br>
        <h2 id="question-text">High-fidelity Prototypes</h2>
        <br>
        <img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%;" src="desktop-hifi.png" alt="This is the hifi prototype for desktop.">
        <p id="p-text">In my desktop hifi prototype, I decided that it would be good to have multiple pictures of their cookies that could show the variety and consistency of their cookies to both attract new customers and show returning customers something they might not have tried. I used display: flex for the elements and they would be flexboxes to allow it to be easy to go from desktop to ipad screen. The elements will change by darkening when hovering over the navigation bar and allowing clicks onto the pictures/text for the "article" that they would correspond to.</p>
        <br>
        <img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%;" src="ipad-hifi.png" alt="This is the hifi prototype for a tablet.">
        <p id="p-text">When shrinking down to the tablet size, I felt that stacking the elements I previously had vertical on the desktop would be best to allow it to have a natural flow where the user would scroll on those devices. Still would use flexboxes and in this case when they are stacked on top of each other it would be easier to adjust with the skinnier screen. Furthermore, the flexbox for the navigation bar would be much easier to scale with the slim screen. </p>
        <br> 
        <img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%;" src="iphone-hifi.png" alt="This is the hifi prototype for a phone.">
        <p id="p-text">Very sismilar to the tablet size screen, the flexbox stacked elements help to adjust with a slim screen versus the wide screen of the desktop. The fonts on the screen alongside the tablet size will adjust by shifting down to a smaller size as the screen becomes too narrow for the current text. Originally, I wanted the the cookie icons to lead to the ordering page, but it becomes much more difficult on the smaller screen. So it wasn't implemented. </p>
